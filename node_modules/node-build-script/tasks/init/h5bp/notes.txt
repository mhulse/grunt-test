First time the init task is run with `h5bp` template, the latest version
of html5-boilerplate is downloaded locally.

The resulting output depends on the few question grunt asks during the
process. This includes some path rewrites (like renaming the
`css/style.css` file to something else).

Simply keep pressing enter for the default h5bp layout.

There's four "step" of prompts:

- project:    Basic project configuration (name, description, version, ...)
- layout:     [D]efault, [C]ustom, [S]illy
- files:      Depends on layout value, series of prompts for specific
              file / directory renames
- gruntfile:  Gruntfile creation

This template tries to guess file and directory paths, but you will most likely
need to edit the generated grunt.js file before running grunt. If you run grunt
after generating grunt.js, and grunt exits with errors, edit the grunt.js file!
