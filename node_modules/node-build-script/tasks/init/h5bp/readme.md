**grunt init template for html5-boilerplate**

---

The root folder will be created the first time the init task is run with
`h5bp` template (eg. `grunt init:h5bp`).

The resulting output depends on the few question grunt asks during the
process. This includes some path rewrites (like renaming the
`css/style.css` file to something else).

Simply keep pressing enter for the default h5bp layout.
