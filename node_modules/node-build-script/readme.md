The h5bp build script now has three versions, the main one being
the [ant-build-script][]. This
project is the node version, and it uses [Grunt][grunt] as a build tool.

It is packaged as a [grunt plugin][] and provides you a bunch of tasks and
helpers to help improve the performance of your site/app in a production
environment.

## Description

This node/grunt-based build script tries to be as close as possible to
the [ant-build-script][], a really great project you should check out.

It is still in early stage of development, but will get better, thanks to [your feedback](https://github.com/h5bp/node-build-script/issues).

## Quick start

**Fancy one line install:**

```sh
# see the gist: https://gist.github.com/2359881
$ curl https://raw.github.com/gist/2359881/install.sh | sh
```

**Slightly less fancier**

```sh
$ npm install https://github.com/h5bp/node-build-script/tarball/master -g
$ h5bp help
$ h5bp init
```

**Developing locally**

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/h5bp/node-build-script.git
$ cd node-build-script
$ npm link
```
